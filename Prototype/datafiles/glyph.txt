Beware to those who seek self-gain. The way is guarded and sealed. Turn back if you are not of the Ancient Blood.

Herein is hidden the last hope of the people of the Earth. Forged with the Covenant of Adama and sealed with three Gems of Power. Protected by the last of the Watchers and constructed by the Ancients.

The way is closed and locked to all with darkness in their hearts. Only one with the light of truth flowing through their veins may pass.

Beware creatures of the depths and their sharp bite.

Sight of Shadow allows one of the Ancient Blood to see the hidden world. It grants strength, speed, and higher immunity to physical attacks.

Only one with command of Shadow Sight may pass through the flames. All others will be burned and scarred for their efforts.

The powers of the Shadow Sight were granted to those who trained in the way of stealth. As the war with the Demons grew long, the Adama, our people, created new ways of combat.

Many Demons had the ability to shape-shift and trick, and so our people countered this with Warriors of Shadow.
Just as the Shadow Sight was granted, so too did many of our people pass into Shadow...
