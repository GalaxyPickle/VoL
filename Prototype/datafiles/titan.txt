Woah!
By the Shams! A child of the Adama!
You must have traveled for many moons to find this secret place. The last time I gazed upon one of your kind, my dear brother, was too long ago.
Too long ago indeed..
You are a hero of your people, my Blue Brother. None have made it this far before. And the Shadow Vision comes naturally to you.
.............
You must activate the Three Gems of Power to awaken The Last Hope for the Children of the Earth. There is little time to chat. I sense a danger...
The Demons. They have thrived and drained Our Mother the Earth for many years, vile and truly lost souls of abomination and Evil that they are.. 
They seek to capture The Last Hope! They have traced your steps, so cunningly and with such darkness that you never sensed them.
Their hubris shall be their downfall. The Last Hope cannot be converted to darkness. It is impossible... However, YOU can be slain, and with you likely all chance of awakening The Last Hope.
Go, be swift! The way is unlocked now that you have broken through the flames. Be on your guard, and may the Light of Truth overcome all darkness. Victory to that Light! Jai Shiva!

The fate of the Adama and all the gentle creatures of the Earth are in your hands. Go, and may the Thirteenth Blade forged in the Covenant of Adama defend your body and deal justice to the Demons.
Through the door to my right lies your trials. May the Light be with you.
