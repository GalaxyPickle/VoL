Don't Mix Yer Drinks - a spadefont
----------------------------------
grungy, handwritten and underestimable - the original spadefont
works at its best in a large size. completely freeware, download and
use as you like but please respect it as exclusively my work. it works
perfectly in ms paint and for most other things, except there appears
to by a slight spacing prob when used in microsoft word. you may hit a
similar glitches in other word processors so this is mainly a display
font as opposed to a text one. well have a go at how it looks in your
word processor, the results may be different. experiment - that is what
this font is there for, anyway.
