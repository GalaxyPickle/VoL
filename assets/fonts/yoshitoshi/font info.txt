It is named in tribute of Tsukioka Yoshitoshi (1839-1892) 
my personal favorite Japanese Ukiyo-e artist.  
If you are an aspiring comic book artist, I urge you to 
seek out Yoshitoshi's artwork online.  You'll be
amazed at how incredibly comic book-like this man's work
was.  Demons and samurai and revenge and sex.  The perfect
concoction for epic work.
