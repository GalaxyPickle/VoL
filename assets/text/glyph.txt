Beware to those who seek self-gain. The way is guarded and sealed. Turn back if you are not of the Ancient Blood.

Herein is hidden the last hope of the people of the Earth. Forged with the Covenant of Adama and sealed with three Gems of Power. Protected by the last of the Watchers and constructed by the Ancients.

The way is closed and locked to all with darkness in their hearts. Only one with the light of truth flowing through their veins may pass.
