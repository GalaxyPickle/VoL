In Ancient times, there were vast gardens of lush and fertile life.
There walked upon Mother Earth The Adama and the Titans.
Then, the Demons descended.
The Demons ravaged all land and life, and took blood from the Adama to sustain their race.
The hordes of the Demons grew mightier each passing season, and soon many of the Adama lost their way, following the deception of the Demons.
The strength of the Titans ebbed, and the Adama became fewer every year...
In a place of secret, the last Titans and Ancients of the Adama met.
Borne of their life energy, they created a weapon of Godly power.
The Covenant of Adama was forged, and the weapon was sealed away with gems of power.
