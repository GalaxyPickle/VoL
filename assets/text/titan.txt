Woah!
By the Shams! A child of the Adama!
You must have traveled for many moons to find this secret place. The last time I gazed upon one of your kind, my dear brother, was too long ago.
Too long ago indeed..
You are a hero of your people, my Blue Brother. None have made it this far before. And the Shadow Vision comes naturally to you.
.............
You must activate the Three Gems of Power to awaken The Last Hope for the Children of the Earth. There is little time to chat. I sense a danger...
The Demons. They have thrived and drained Our Mother the Earth for many years, vile and truly lost souls of abomination and Evil that they are.. 
They seek to capture The Last Hope! One Demon has traced your steps, so cunningly and with such darkness that you never sensed it.
Its hubris shall be its downfall. It hopes to keep its perceived victory for itself. It hopes to slay you.
Go, be swift! The way is unlocked now that you have broken through the flames. Be on your guard, and may the Light of Truth be with you!

The fate of the Adama and all the gentle creatures of the Earth are in your hands. Go, and may the Thirteenth Blade forged in the Covenant of Adama defend your body and deal justice to the Demons.
Through the door to my right lies your trials. May the Light be with you.
