Kill the worms to charge your special up.
Hit the boss in the face and with the very tip of your sword to score extra special points.

The level is over once you defeat the boss.
It's a demo level and I intend to scrap it for the final game.

If you really want to read more of the lore, you have to jump up the side of the boss arena ;).
